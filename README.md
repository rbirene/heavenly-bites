# Heavenly Bites

This website has been created for a workshop for Women'sTec #NotJustForBoys Computing Week Summer 2020 which aims to make a career in tech more accessible to young girls.

I led a web development session for teenage girls over the summer during the COVID-19 pandemic, teaching students how to create a website using HTML and CSS, introducing them to coding concepts for the first time, encouraging them to pursue a career in tech and breaking down myths and stereotypes about the tech industry.

## Introduction

You are a web developer and have been asked to create a website for a confectionery called, Heavenly Bites.

They want a website to let customers browse their products, like cakes and donuts, read more about them and also contact them if they want to place an order.

Following this session, you will be developing this website using the technical languages, HTML and CSS.

Donâ€™t worry if you have never coded before! We will be building this website step-by-step and you will learn as you go!
